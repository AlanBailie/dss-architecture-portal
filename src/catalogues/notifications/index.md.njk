- mail (physical printed letter)
- electronic mail
- SMS (text)
- mobile notification
- broadcast notifications
- Slack, Facebook Messenger or similar platforms

## Required attributes (non-functional requirements)

### Performance

TBD

### Availability

The notifications is a key component in providing citzen facing services and therefore should be highly available, that is should have an availability target of 99.9%.

### Recoverability

Following a failure the system should be restored to full operation within 1 hour.

### Reliability

The infrastructure services on which the notifications application resides should be resilient and fault tolerant so as to minimise failures.

### Integrity

The entries in the service catalogue represent the definitive list of services offered. The list should accurately reflect the service being offered.

### Scalability

The service catalogue should be scalable to meet increasing or descreasing demand. Scaling may be manual or automtic.

### Security

The notifications application should prevent any unauthorised access to its associated data. More specifically the maintainance of the catalgue entries should be restricted to authorised users only.

### Serviceability

The notifications application must be supportable by the NICS and/or its delivery partners. The support of the notifications application should be easily transferable.

### Usability

The notifications application should be easily used by its consumers. Any user interface elements should meet current NICS UX standards and comply with accessiblity legislation.

### Portability

It should be possible to move the notification application to another hosting platform.

### Interoperability

The notifications building block must provide clearly defined APIs to facilitate the integration with other related building blocks.

###Interfaces

- APIs to send message on the specified channels
- UI to layer on top of the API to provide the service directly to a service consumer

## Dependent building blocks

TBD
