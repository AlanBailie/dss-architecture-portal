title: Architecture Building Blocks

Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) describe the capability/competencies our organisation requires and provide the basis for the specification of Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) that will implement that capability.

Building blocks represent (potentially re-usable) components  that we combine with other building blocks to deliver our architectures and solutions. Our building blocks can be defined at various levels of detail, depending on the stage of architecture development has been reached.

For instance, at an early stage, a building block can simply consist of a name or an outline description. Later on, a building block may be decomposed into multiple supporting building blocks and may be accompanied by a full specification. Building blocks can relate to "architectures" (things that guide and shape what we have and do) or "solutions" (things we have to execute what we do).

Below is our current list of used/reusable architecture building blocks. Each link opens a catalogue. When you are looking for connections between entries in different catalogues first open the catalogues for each entry and if a link exists to entries in other catalogues it will be shown against that entry.

All new or changed solutions should normally use existing ABBs. If there is a need to use new or changed ABBs they should be reviewed as part of the solution conformance process and given either architecture approval or a dispensation in order to progress to the build phases of development.

        The managed business activities/processes we carry out aligned to our contracts for the operation of these services. A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract about the nature of the specific outcomes to be delivered from a defined service. The contract identifies service qualities and the expected performance measures. A service has an interface (how it can be requested), a contract (what should be assumed and what should happen if the assumptions hold) and an implementation (how it will be carried out). <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Business services</span> are usually described using processes. <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Application or information system services</span> are usually described in terms of application component interactions that realise business processes. <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Platform services</span> provide the environments (devices and networks) on which application components executing application services can run. <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Data services</span> (as identified above) perform the basic CRUD operations on stored or provided data required by the application components.

        How we organise and manage resources to deliver business function in specific combinations and circumstances generating specific outcomes to our process customers (internal or external). A process represents a sequence of activities that together achieve a specified outcome. They can be decomposed into sub-processes, and  may generate/respond to multiple events in order to satisfy one or more activities. Each process may include controls - decision-making steps with accompanying decision logic used to determine execution approach for a process or to ensure that a process complies with governance criteria. For example, a sign-off control on the purchase request processing process that checks whether the total value of the request is within the sign-off limits of the requester, or whether it needs escalating to higher authority. As we manage our business operations using the concept of services our processes implement the activities needed to deliver our services and the service contract represents the agreed outcome that the process (or set of processes) should create for its customers.

A business function is usually a concept agreed within an industry or business context rather than being specific to one organisation. (Note the term "business functions" - with an (s) - is often used in business management. This use usually refers to an organisation unit that normally delivers this business capability rather than the business capability itself.)
