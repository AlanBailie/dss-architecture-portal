The components presented below have been split into 2 categories as per the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.opengroup.org/public/arch/p3/trm/trm_dtail.htm">TOGAF Technical Reference Model</a>.

## Business applications

Business applications implement business processes for a particular enterprise or industry. Such applications typically model elements of a an enterprise's domain of activity or business processes.

### NICS business applications

- business event tracking
- chatbot
- consulations
- document exchange
- document management
- geographic information system
- identity management
- information asset management
- <a class="govuk-link" href="#notifications">notifications</a>
- <a class="govuk-link" href="#service-catalogue">service catalogue</a>

<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</a>

### High-level requirements

Send a message to a service consumer or subscriber using any of the following channels via a user interface or API:

- mail (physical printed letter)
- electronic mail
- SMS (text)
- mobile notification
- broadcast notifications
- Slack, Facebook Messenger or similar platforms

### Required attributes (non-functional requirements)


#### Performance

TBD

#### Availability

The notifications is a key component in providing citzen facing services and therefore should be highly available, that is should have an availability target of 99.9%.

#### Recoverability

Following a failure the system should be restored to full operation within 1 hour.

#### Reliability

The infrastructure services on which the notifications application resides should be resilient and fault tolerant so as to minimise failures.

#### Integrity

The entries in the service catalogue represent the definitive list of services offered. The list should accurately reflect the service being offered.

#### Scalability

The service catalogue should be scalable to meet increasing or descreasing demand. Scaling may be manual or automtic.

#### Security

The notifications application should prevent any unauthorised access to its associated data. More specifically the maintainance of the catalgue entries should be restricted to authorised users only.

#### Serviceability

The notifications application must be supportable by the NICS and/or its delivery partners. The support of the notifications application should be easily transferable.

#### Usability

The notifications application should be easily used by its consumers. Any user interface elements should meet current NICS UX standards and comply with accessiblity legislation.

#### Portability

It should be possible to move the notification application to another hosting platform.

#### Interoperability

The notifications building block must provide clearly defined APIs to facilitate the integration with other related building blocks.

### Interfaces

- APIs to send message on the specified channels
- UI to layer on top of the API to provide the service directly to a service consumer

### Dependent building blocks

TBD


### Related solution building blocks (SBBs)

- Identity
- IT Assist SMTP
- GOV.UK Notify
- Mobile App

<h2 id="service-catalogue">Service catalogue</a>

### High-level requirements

- Browse catalogue entries
- Search catalogue
- Create, amend, remove entries from the catalogue

### Required attributes (non-functional requirements)

#### Performance

The service catalogue should have a maximum response time of 1 second measured at the network perimeter before entering the Internet.

#### Availability

The service catalogue is a key component in providing citzen facing services and therefore should be highly available, that is should have an availability target of 99.9%.

#### Recoverability

Following a failure the system should be restored to full operation within 1 hour.

#### Reliability

The infrastructure services on which the service catalogue application resides should be resilient and fault tolerant so as to minimise failures.

#### Integrity

The entries in the service catalogue represent the definitive list of services offered. The list should accurately reflect the service being offered.

#### Scalability

The service catalogue should be scalable to meet increasing or descreasing demand. Scaling may be manual or automtic.

#### Security

The service catalogue application should prevent any unauthorised access to its associated data. More specifically the maintainance of the catalgue entries should be restricted to authorised users only.

#### Serviceability

The service catalogue must be supportable by the NICS and/or its delivery partners. The support of the catalogue should be easily transferable.

#### Usability

The service catalogue should be easily used by its consumers. Any user interface elements should meet current NICS UX standards and comply with accessiblity legislation.

#### Portability

It should be possible to move the service catalogue to another platform or at least transfer the catalogue content to another platform.

#### Interoperability

The service catalogue must provide clearly defined APIs to facilitate the integration with other related building blocks.

### Interfaces

- search API
- CRUD UI
- catalogue storage

### Dependent building blocks

- Citizen portal
- Mobile app
- Chatbot
- Identity

### Related solution building blocks (SBBs)

- Drupal Service Catalogue
